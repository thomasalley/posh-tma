# posh-tma

A collection of Powershell bits and pieces I've had laying around, collected into a module.

## To-Do

### General Cleanup
Most of these bits I've had in use in both production and in my homelab over the last several years- and as such, they display a varying level of Powershell skill. It's my goal to get them all updated to my modern standards, in the hope that someone will find them useful.
